## MidtermNovember2020


### Submission Process :
- Hard Deadline: 11th November EOD.
- Download the zip of the project --> unzip and open using Intellij --> File --> New --> Project Using Existing Source --> 
Select the downloaded (unzipped) project's directory --> Create Project From Existing Source
- Make sure to add all required dependencies into your IntelliJ Library
- Create your own repository in GitHub and verify your local repo is pointing to your newly created remote repo by 
using `git remote -v` (if not, change using git remote set-url <existing remote name> <new repo URL>) 
- Make sure you are pushing your code every time you solve a problem or finish a task.
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUSH ANY CODE CONTAINING ANY ERRORS.
- Once you create your GitHub repo, [click here to add your repo URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xa0xRvQs5ySBNhmv-eof2sYbQaxiShjqP41vdfwheio/edit?usp=sharing)

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Must complete all coding problems.
- Read the questions thoroughly and understand what is being asked of you. There are files/code for you to explore/learn from. 
Try to understand things, and how everything is working.
- Google should be used to learn, however, don't feel free to copy and paste answers. You only hurt yourself if you copy and don't try
to understand the solution.
- Once submissions are in, we will be reviewing the midterm together. I will be randomly calling on individuals to present their
solutions.
